      <description>A directed acyclic graph or DAG is a directed graph with no directed cycles.
An arbitrary directed graph may also be transformed into a DAG, called its condensation, by contracting each of its strongly connected components into a single super vertex.
Go&amp;rsquo;s import declaration declares a dependency relation between the importing and imported package. It is illegal for a package to import itself, directly or indirectly, or to directly import a package without referring to any of its exported identifiers.</description>
