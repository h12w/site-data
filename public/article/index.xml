      <description>A summary of Boolean algebra Given the following notations:
 a proposition is denoted as a lowercase letter, e.g. $p$, $q$ the truth value of a proposition $p$ is denoted as $ B(p) \in \set{0, 1} $, where $B(p)=1$ if $p$ is true or $B(p)=0$ if $p$ is false  Negation (not, $¬$), conjunction (and, $∧$) and disjunction (or, $∨$) are defined by the truth tables below:
   $B(p)$ $B(¬p)$     0 1   1 0</description>

      <title>Go Patterns: Context-aware Lock</title>
      <link>http://h12.io/article/go-patterns-context-aware-lock/</link>

      <description>We often use Mutex or RWMutex as locks in Go, but sometimes we need a lock that can be cancelled by a context during the lock attempt.
The pattern is simple - we use a channel with length 1:
lockChan := make(chan struct{}, 1) lockChan &amp;lt;- struct{}{} // lock &amp;lt;- lockChan // unlock  When multiple goroutines try to obtain the lock, only one of them is able to fill into the only slot, and the rest are blocked until the slot is empty again after a readout.</description>

      <title>Go Patterns: Buffered Writer</title>
      <link>http://h12.io/article/go-patterns-buffered-writer/</link>

      <description>A buffered writer is so ubiquitous that we do not usually consider it as a pattern, but sometimes we reinvent it or even do it in an inferior way. Let us look at a real use case first.
Batch processor What would you do to improve the throughput of a service? The answer is short: batching.
By processing and sending in a batch of multiple items instead of a single item at a time, you are amortizing the network overhead from the request-response round trip among all the items in the batch.</description>

      <title>Value vs Pointer Receivers</title>

      <description>Should I use value receivers or pointer receivers?
Value receivers have some benefits include immutability, concurrent safety and clean logic (not always, often true). But to what extend can I use value receivers without an issue or performance penalty?
In the Go FAQ, there are 3 rules:
 most important, does the method need to modify the receiver? If it does, the receiver must be a pointer if the receiver is large, a big struct for instance, it will be much cheaper to use a pointer receiver if some of the methods of the type must have pointer receivers, the rest should too, so the method set is consistent regardless of how the type is used  Let&amp;rsquo;s look at rule 1.</description>

      <title>Learning Haskell the Hard Way</title>
      <link>http://h12.io/article/learn-haskell/</link>

      <description>When I was reading the collection of learning resources on Haskell and tried to find a good start, I quickly realized that none of the books or tutorials are suitable for me: the easier a tutorial claims to be, the harder to really understand Haskell by reading it. What I need is a terse documentation that introduces the syntax and semantics of Haskell systematically and clearly, but unfortunately none was found.</description>

      <title>How to Achieve a Perfect PageSpeed Insights Score</title>
      <link>http://h12.io/article/pagespeed-insights/</link>

      <description>Indtroduction PageSpeed Insights is an online tool by Google to measure the performance of an web page for mobile and desktop devices. It has a set of heuristic rules considering the network-independent aspects of page performance. Each rule has a weight and the total score ranges from 0 to 100 points. The desktop and mobile tests have the same set of rules for performance and mobile test has some extra rules about user experience.</description>

      <title>Finding Optimal Typographic Scale</title>
      <link>http://h12.io/article/optimal-font-scale/</link>

      <guid>http://h12.io/article/optimal-font-scale/</guid>
      <description>During the construction of this site, there are many important design decisions that need to be made. One of them is to decide the font size for each level of headings, i.e., typographic scale.
Investigation The first thing I did was to read everything online about typographic scale. I will just skip the details and jump to my opinions:
 Modular scale should be followed Traditional scale is obsolete Golden ratio or double-stranded scale do not make any sense Vertical rhythm should be considered  Then a little explanation.</description>
